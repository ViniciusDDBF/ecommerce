Be short and precise (1–2 lines of description).

Include a brief note if it performs cleanup or any side effect.

Document each parameter with @param, giving a short human-readable explanation.

Always include @returns even if it’s void.

Add a concise usage example inside a @example block using TypeScript syntax.

Do not restate type information already visible in TypeScript.

Do not include JSDoc for types/interfaces unless necessary.

Use a tone suitable for professional React/TypeScript libraries (like react-use or ahooks).
